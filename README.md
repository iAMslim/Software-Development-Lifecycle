# **README: Sprint Review and Retrospective**

## **Interpreting User Needs & User Stories**
User needs are identified through stakeholder engagement and broken into **user stories** for clarity and prioritization. User stories help define **clear goals, acceptance criteria, and iterations** to refine features effectively. In the SNHU Travel project, this approach streamlined the vacation package search feature.

## **Approach to Development & Agile Processes**
I use an **iterative Agile approach**: define requirements, break tasks into sprints, test continuously, and refine. Key Agile processes I plan to use include **Daily Stand-ups, Sprint Planning, Backlog Refinement, and Retrospectives** for better collaboration and efficiency.

## **Being a Good Team Member**
A strong team member **communicates clearly, collaborates effectively, adapts to changes, and takes accountability**. In the SNHU Travel project, teamwork ensured seamless adjustments to stakeholder requests and improved project outcomes.

This README summarizes Agile principles and team dynamics for effective software development.
